# theatreV1
The website development project for "The Local Theatre" company aims to create a responsive website that provides a welcome page, contact information, and micro-blog style page that allows the company to make announcements, provide movie and performance reviews and disseminate other related information to their customer base
This project was developed as the final assignment for a web development course, under the guidance of a supervisor. The PHP was utilized alongside XMP metadata, employing specific libraries and extensions to work with this data. For instance, libraries like PHP-XMPWriter were used to create and manipulate XMP metadata efficiently.
